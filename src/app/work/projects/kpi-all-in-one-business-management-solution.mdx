## Overview

Led the infrastructure transformation and DevOps practices for KPI.com, a data analytics platform. Responsible for CI/CD implementation, containerization, monitoring infrastructure, and performance optimization across multiple environments.

## Key Achievements

### CI/CD Transformation

- Successfully migrated from Jenkins to GitLab CI for streamlined DevOps workflow
- Reduced build time by **2x** through optimized building strategies and intelligent caching
- Implemented automated build and deploy pipelines for dev, staging, and production environments
- Maintained Jenkins infrastructure during transition period, including version upgrades and plugin management
- Automated deployment process for main project and all associated microservices

### Infrastructure as Code & Automation

- Implemented **Monitoring as Code** using Ansible for complete monitoring stack deployment
- Automated installation and configuration of Grafana, Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Node Exporter
- Created reusable Ansible playbooks eliminating manual server configuration
- Managed infrastructure entirely through code - only server provisioning remained manual

### Containerization & Service Management

- Containerized critical services: Kafka, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Redis, Solr
- Implemented PostgreSQL with PGBouncer connection pooling for non-production environments
- Ensured consistent environments across dev, staging, and production

### Performance Optimization & Monitoring

- Deep-dived into Tomcat/JVM monitoring using JMX Exporter
- Analyzed historical monitoring data to optimize resource allocation
- Configured JVM memory limits based on actual server resources to prevent OOM kills
- Improved system uptime to **99.9%** through proactive monitoring and alerting

### Multi-Environment Management

- Managed complex multi-environment setup (dev, staging, production)
- Handled multiple instances per environment for high-availability services
- Implemented environment-specific configurations while maintaining code consistency

## Technical Stack

- **CI/CD:** GitLab CI, Jenkins (legacy)
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **IaC & Automation:** Ansible (Playbooks, Roles, Inventories)
- **Monitoring:** Grafana, Prometheus, Alertmanager, Node Exporter, JMX Exporter, CAdvisor
- **Services:** PostgreSQL, PGBouncer, Kafka, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Redis, Solr
- **Application Server:** Tomcat
- **Version Control:** Git, GitLab

## Impact
- **2x faster** build times
- **99.9%** system uptime
- **100%** automated deployments across all environments
- Zero manual monitoring stack deployments
- Eliminated OOM kills through JVM optimization
