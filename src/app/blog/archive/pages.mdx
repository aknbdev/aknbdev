## Enable or disable pages

Magic Portfolio's `RouteGuard` component takes care of conditionally rendering pages based on the `routes` object in the `resources/config.js` file.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="6"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const routes = {
    '/':        true,
    '/about':   true,
    '/work':    true,
    '/blog':    true,
    '/gallery': false,
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/config.js"
  }
]} />

The code above will ensure that the `/gallery` page is not accessible and is not displayed in the navigation.

## Add new pages

When creating a new page, it needs to be added to the `routes` object in the `resources/config.js` file.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="6"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const routes = {
    '/':        true,
    '/about':   true,
    '/work':    true,
    '/blog':    true,
    '/gallery': false,
    '/music': true,
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/config.js"
  }
]} />

The code above will ensure that the `/music` page is accessible. Users will be able to navigate to it after adding it to the navigation menu in the `components/Header.tsx` file.
