# Assalamu Alaikum! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Abdulaziz Karimbaev, a DevOps Engineer based in Uzbekistan with a passion for automation, infrastructure, and making developers' lives easier. Welcome to my corner of the internet where I'll be sharing my experiences, lessons learned, and hopefully some useful insights from my journey in the DevOps world.

## Who Am I?

I started my career as a Java Backend Developer back in 2021, building REST APIs and working with Spring Boot Applications. But somewhere along the way, I fell in love with the infrastructure side of thingsâ€”the CI/CD pipelines, the automation scripts, the thrill of optimizing a deployment from 10 minutes down to 2.

Today, I work as a DevOps Engineer at KPI.com, where I manage multi-environment CI/CD pipelines, containerized infrastructure, and monitoring systems. I also take on freelance projects, helping businesses in Uzbekistan migrate to the cloud, automate their deployments, and build scalable infrastructure.

Over the past 2.5+ years, I've:
- Migrated CI/CD systems from Jenkins to GitLab CI
- Containerized services like Kafka, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Redis, Minio, and PostgreSQL
- Implemented monitoring stacks with Grafana, Prometheus, and Alertmanager
- Reduced build times by 2x through optimization and caching
- Achieved 99.9% system uptime through proactive monitoring
- Migrated applications from local providers to AWS cloud with auto-scaling
- Built complete infrastructure from scratch using Infrastructure as Code

But honestly? I'm still learning every single day. And that's exactly why I'm starting this blog.

## Why This Blog?

I've noticed something in our tech community here in Uzbekistanâ€”there's a wealth of knowledge scattered across Telegram channels, GitHub repos, and conversations over choy. But sometimes, what we need is a place where someone says, "Hey, I faced this exact problem, and here's how I solved it."

That's what I want this blog to be.

**I'm writing this for:**
- **Junior engineers** who are just starting their DevOps journey and need practical guidance beyond the tutorials
- **Backend developers** who are curious about the infrastructure side and want to understand what happens after `git push`
- **Senior engineers** who might find a different perspective or approach to a problem they're tackling
- **The Uzbek tech community** who want to see what's possible when you combine traditional knowledge with modern DevOps practices

## What Will I Write About?

Honestly? Whatever I'm working on, learning, or finding interesting at the moment. But here are some themes you can expect:

### Real-World DevOps Stories
I'll share actual problems I've faced and how I solved them. Like that time I had to debug a CPU leak on a production server during peak traffic, or when I optimized JVM settings to prevent OOM kills after analyzing weeks of monitoring data.

### CI/CD & Automation
From Jenkins migrations to GitLab CI, from simple deployment scripts to complex multi-environment pipelines. I'll break down what works, what doesn't, and why.

### Infrastructure as Code
Ansible has become my go-to tool for automation. I'll share playbooks, patterns, and the "monitoring as code" approach that changed how I think about infrastructure.

### Containerization & Orchestration
Docker, Docker Compose, and everything in between. Practical guides on containerizing services and managing them in production.

### Monitoring & Performance
How to actually use Grafana and Prometheus beyond just installing them. JVM monitoring, database optimization, and making sense of metrics that matter.

### Cloud Migrations
My experiences migrating applications to AWS, dealing with auto-scaling, load balancers, and the reality of cloud costs versus on-premise setups.

### Tips, Tricks, and TILs
Quick wins, bash one-liners, and those "Today I Learned" moments that make you think, "I wish I knew this a year ago."

### DevOps in Uzbekistan
The unique challenges and opportunities we face hereâ€”from infrastructure limitations to working with local hosting providers, from budget constraints to building for the Uzbek market.

## What This Blog Won't Be

- **Not a tutorial factory**: I won't rewrite documentation that already exists. If the official docs explain something well, I'll link to them and focus on my experience using it.
- **Not always perfect**: I'll share my mistakes too. Sometimes the best learning comes from "here's what I did wrong."
- **Not on a schedule**: I write when I have something worth sharing. Quality over consistency.

## My Writing Style

I believe technical content doesn't have to be dry. I'll mix:
- Detailed technical breakdowns when needed
- Story-driven posts about real projects
- Quick tips and practical examples
- Honest reflections on tools, practices, and trade-offs

I'll write in English (to reach a wider audience), but I'm always thinking about our Uzbek tech community. If something is relevant specifically to infrastructure or practices in Uzbekistan, I'll make sure to highlight that.

## What's Next?

I've got a backlog of ideas I'm excited to write about:

- **"From Jenkins to GitLab CI: A Migration Story"** - The real reasons we migrated and lessons learned
- **"Monitoring as Code with Ansible"** - How I automated our entire monitoring stack deployment
- **"The 2x Build Time Reduction"** - Optimization strategies that actually worked
- **"AWS Migration on a Budget"** - Making cloud infrastructure work for Uzbek startups
- **"My Home Lab Setup"** - Learning DevOps without breaking production (or the bank)
- **"PostgreSQL Performance Tuning"** - From slow queries to PGBouncer configuration

But I'm also open to requests. If there's something you want me to write about, drop me a message.

## Let's Connect

This isn't meant to be a one-way conversation. I'm learning as much as I'm sharing. If you:
- Have questions about something I wrote
- Want to share your own experience
- Disagree with an approach I took (technical discussions welcome!)
- Have suggestions for topics

Please reach out! You can find me on:

## A Personal Note

Starting a blog has been on my "someday" list for way too long. Every time I solved an interesting problem, I'd think, "I should write about this." But I'd get caught up in the next task, the next deadline, the next fire to put out.

What changed? I realized that the knowledge I'm gaining every day has value beyond just my current projects. The Uzbek tech community is growing, and we need more people sharing their real experiencesâ€”not just the successes, but the failures, the pivots, and the "I have no idea what I'm doing but let's figure it out" moments.

So here we are. This is my commitment to documenting the journey, sharing what I learn, and hopefully helping someone else avoid the mistakes I've made (or at least make new, more interesting ones).

Whether you're a junior engineer just starting out, a senior engineer exploring new approaches, or somewhere in betweenâ€”I hope you'll find something useful here.

Welcome aboard, and let's learn together.
